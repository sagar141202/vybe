# Vybe — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Owner:** Personal Project
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-15

## 1. Elevator Pitch

**Vybe** is a personal, self-hosted music streaming app for Android that streams any song from YouTube instantly — with album art, time-synced lyrics, AI recommendations, and offline downloads — at zero cost and with zero ads, forever.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Spotify Premium costs ₹119/month. YouTube Music Premium costs ₹99/month. Apple Music costs ₹99/month. Over 5 years, that is ₹7,140–₹8,580 spent just to listen to music I could access for free. Existing free alternatives either have:

- **Ads** that break listening flow
- **No offline support** (requires internet at all times)
- **No lyrics** or only static (non-synced) lyrics
- **No recommendations** that learn from personal taste
- **No album art** or poor quality thumbnails
- **No background playback** with lock screen controls
- **No crossfade, equalizer, or sleep timer**

Vybe solves every single one of these gaps. It is built for personal use only, runs on a home server or free cloud tier, and gives a premium experience that rivals or exceeds paid services.

## 6. Non-Goals & Constraints

### 6.1 Non-Goals
- **Not a public product.** This will never be distributed, monetized, or made available to others. It is for personal use only.
- **Not a YouTube downloader for redistribution.** Audio is streamed, not redistributed.
- **No social features** (following, public profiles, sharing to social media) in MVP.
- **No iOS support** in V1 — Android only.
- **No web app** in V1 — mobile-first, API-backed.

### 6.2 Constraints
- **Budget: ₹0.** All infrastructure must be free tier or self-hosted.
- **No paid APIs.** YouTube Data API v3 has a free quota; ytmusicapi needs no key.
- **Backend must run on a modest machine** — home PC or Render/Railway free tier.
- **Legal:** Personal use only. Not a commercial product. yt-dlp usage is the user's own responsibility.

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to first audio byte | < 3 seconds from search result tap |
| Search result accuracy | First result is correct song > 90% of the time |
| Lyrics sync accuracy | Within ± 0.5 seconds of audio |
| Offline playback | Works 100% without any internet connection |
| App crash rate | 0 crashes per day in normal usage |

---

## 8. Technical Constraints

- Android 10+ (API level 29+) minimum target
- FastAPI backend must respond to `/stream` within 1.5s (yt-dlp URL fetch + cache check)
- Redis stream URL cache TTL: 5 hours (YouTube URLs expire ~6 hours)
- Postgres free tier (Supabase): 500MB limit — store metadata only, never audio blobs
- Max playlist size: 5,000 tracks
- Offline storage: User-managed, no auto-purge

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| yt-dlp breaks due to YouTube changes | Medium | High | Monitor yt-dlp releases, auto-update weekly |
| Stream URL cache miss causes delay | High | Medium | Warm cache for "Recently Played" on app open |
| lrclib missing lyrics for obscure songs | Medium | Low | Fallback to Genius scraper, then show static lyrics |
| Supabase free tier quota exceeded | Low | Medium | Archive old play history, compress metadata |
| Railway/Render free tier sleeping | Medium | High | Use self-hosted or configure uptime ping |

## 10. Open Questions

- [ ] Should the backend expose a public URL (via Cloudflare Tunnel) or run LAN-only with Tailscale?
- [ ] Should the recommendation engine run as a background job (nightly) or on-demand?
- [ ] Should collaborative listening use a dedicated WebSocket server or piggyback on FastAPI's WebSocket support?
- [ ] At what point (hours of history) does the recommendation model have enough data to be useful?
