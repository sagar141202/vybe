# Vybe — Design Document

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-15

## 1. Design Philosophy

Vybe's design is built on one principle: **music is the product, not the UI**.

Every design decision should fade into the background and let the album art, lyrics, and music take centre stage. The interface should feel like holding a physical record — warm, tactile, and alive. Not a dashboard. Not an app. A listening experience.

**Core aesthetic:** Dark glass. Blurred album-art backgrounds that shift with every track. Typography that is large, confident, and readable at arm's length. Animations that feel musical — they breathe and pulse with the beat.

**Inspiration (collect these screenshots into your DESIGN folder):**
- Spotify's Now Playing screen (full-bleed art, minimal controls)
- BlackHole app (iOS, dark glass aesthetic)
- Lasso app (artist discovery, card-based browsing)
- Apple Music's lyrics view (karaoke-style word highlight)
- Doppler 2 (iOS, warm audiophile UI)
- Vinyls app (turntable animation, album-art focus)

## 2. Visual Identity

### 2.1 Color System

The UI uses a dynamic color system where the primary accent is extracted from the current track's album art using Palette API (Android). The palette shifts with every song.

**Base tokens (dark mode — primary):**
```
--bg-primary:       #0A0A0A   (near black, main background)
--bg-secondary:     #141414   (cards, bottom sheet)
--bg-tertiary:      #1E1E1E   (input fields, inactive tabs)
--bg-glass:         rgba(20, 20, 20, 0.7) + blur(24px)

--text-primary:     #FFFFFF   (track title, primary labels)
--text-secondary:   #A0A0A0   (artist name, metadata)
--text-tertiary:    #606060   (timestamps, disabled state)

--accent-dynamic:   [extracted from album art — changes per track]
--accent-fallback:  #1DB954   (Spotify green as default)

--border:           rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
--border-strong:    rgba(255,255,255,0.15)
```

**Light mode tokens (optional — implement after dark mode is perfect):**
```
--bg-primary:       #F5F5F5
--bg-secondary:     #FFFFFF
--text-primary:     #121212
--text-secondary:   #6B6B6B
```

### 2.2 Typography

```
Display (track title, full player):
  Font:   Instrument Serif (Google Fonts — elegant, musical)
  Size:   32px
  Weight: 400 (let the letterform do the work)

Heading (section titles, artist names):
  Font:   DM Sans
  Size:   18px
  Weight: 600

Body (lyrics, metadata, descriptions):
  Font:   DM Sans
  Size:   15px
  Weight: 400

Caption (timestamps, badges, mini labels):
  Font:   DM Sans
  Size:   12px
  Weight: 500
  Letter-spacing: 0.5px
  Text-transform: uppercase

Monospace (debug info, BPM display):
  Font:   JetBrains Mono
  Size:   13px
```

**Why Instrument Serif for the display?** Most music apps use grotesque sans-serifs everywhere and feel sterile. The serif display font on the track title gives a luxe, editorial feeling — like seeing a band name on a concert poster.

### 2.3 Spacing Scale

```
xs:   4px
sm:   8px
md:   16px
lg:   24px
xl:   32px
2xl:  48px
3xl:  64px
```

### 2.4 Corner Radius

```
pill:       9999px  (buttons, tags, badges)
card:       20px    (album art, cards, bottom sheets)
input:      12px    (search bar, form elements)
icon-btn:   50%     (circular icon buttons)
```

### 2.5 Elevation / Shadow

```
Level 1 (cards):      0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
Level 2 (player):     0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.6)
Level 3 (modals):     0 16px 64px rgba(0,0,0,0.8)
Glow (accent):        0 0 24px [accent-color at 40% opacity]
```

**Lyrics scroll:**
- Current line: scale 1.0 → 1.04, color text-tertiary → text-primary (100ms)
- Scroll position: smooth spring animation, not linear

**Progress bar:**
- Scrubbing: thumb scales up (1.0 → 1.5), elapsed time shown in tooltip above thumb

### 4.3 Accessibility

## 6. Dark / Light Mode

Dark mode is the default and primary design target. Light mode is a future nice-to-have.

The blurred background technique works exceptionally well in dark mode (dark overlay + blur = gorgeous). In light mode, it requires a lighter overlay and different shadow treatment.

**Switch control:** System-follows (respects Android system setting). Manual override in Settings.

---

## 7. Empty States

Every list screen must have a thoughtful empty state — not just "No items found."

| Screen | Empty State Message | Action |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Library > Liked Songs | "Nothing liked yet. Heart a track to save it here." | Search button |
| Library > Downloads | "No offline tracks. Download songs to listen without Wi-Fi." | Search button |
| Library > Playlists | "Your playlists will live here. Create one?" | "New Playlist" button |
| Home (no history) | "Welcome! Search for any song to get started." | Search button |
| Search (no results) | "No results for '[query]'. Try different keywords." | — |

---

---

## 9. Error States

|-------|-------------|
