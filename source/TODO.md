## Notes

- **Do not skip T-000 to T-010.** Project skeleton first. Every time. No exceptions.
- **Each task should result in a separate git commit** using conventional commit format.
- **Create a GitHub Issue for each task** and close it with the PR. This gives you a visual kanban board.
- **Never merge a PR that breaks the CI pipeline.**
- **If a task is blocked (status: `~`)**, document WHY in a comment on the GitHub Issue.
- **Effort estimates are rough.** If a task takes 3× estimated time, break it into subtasks.
